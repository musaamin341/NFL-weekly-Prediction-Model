🏈 NFL Predictions 2025 - Machine Learning Model

Welcome to the NFL Game Prediction Models repository! This project uses machine learning, NFL data APIs, and historical game results to predict NFL game outcomes for the 2025 season and beyond.

🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains ensemble machine learning models that predict NFL game results based on team performance metrics, historical data, and advanced statistical analysis. The model leverages:

nfl_data_py for comprehensive NFL datasets
Historical game results from 2015-2024
Real-time team statistics and performance metrics
Advanced feature engineering for improved predictions
Ensemble learning combining Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression
📊 Data Sources
nfl_data_py: Official NFL data package for accessing play-by-play data, team stats, and game schedules
Historical NFL Results: Processed from 2015-2024 seasons for model training
Team Performance Metrics: Passing/rushing yards, points scored, turnovers, and other key statistics
🏈 How It Works
Data Collection: Scripts pull NFL data using nfl_data_py (play-by-play, team stats, schedules)
Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Calculates team metrics, home field advantage, and performance indicators
Model Training: Ensemble models trained using historical game results with feature selection
Prediction: Models predict game winners with confidence percentages
Evaluation: Performance measured using accuracy metrics and backtesting
Dependencies
nfl_data_py
xgboost
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib

📈 Model Performance
The models are evaluated using multiple metrics:

Overall Accuracy: 55-60% on historical data
High Confidence Predictions: 62-65% accuracy
2023 Season Validation: 56.5% accuracy across 267 games
Cross-Validation: 59.6% average with ±1.9% standard deviation
Key Features Used:
Home/away passing yards per game
Home/away rushing yards per game
Points scored per game (using fantasy points as proxy)
Passing touchdowns per game
Interceptions thrown per game
Rushing touchdowns per game
Fumbles lost per game
Home field advantage adjustments
Turnover differentials
Game context (week, season, playoff status)
